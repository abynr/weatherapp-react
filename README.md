This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Building
This project was based on the Create React App, which allowed for learning as I followed along different parts of it, allowing myself to build a fully functioning weather app. This app uses [openweathermap.org's](https://openweathermap.org/) api. The background changes based on the temperature shown. This project was mainly Javascript and CSS.
